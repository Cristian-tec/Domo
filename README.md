## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cristiantek.ml/domo_portada.png)

Application made to connect devices anywhere in the world. The app connects to an Oracle server, through the MQTT (Message Queing Telemetry Transport) protocol, and it sends the data to the devices subscribed to it.
The devices (IoT) are connected to the same server and exchange information through the same MQTT protocol.
All this is displayed in our application, which allows us to easily control and monitor it, from any browser, on desktop or mobile.
